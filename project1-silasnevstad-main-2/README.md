# Project 1: Shell

This is the starter code for [Project 1](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs3650f22/p1.html).

The [Makefile](Makefile) contains the following targets:

- `make all` - compile everything
- `make tokenize` - compile the tokenizer demo
- `make shell` - compile the shell
- `make shell-tests` - run a few tests against the shell
- `make test` - compile and run all the tests
- `make clean` - perform a minimal clean-up of the source tree


The [examples](examples/) directory contains an example tokenizer. It might help.
